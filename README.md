# **Project LEMUR: Observability and Context** 

Start with documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/turbonomic/lemur/wiki). Developers can use Lemur and [Lemurctl](https://github.com/turbonomic/lemur/wiki/Lemurctl) to understand their microservice applications in the context of the stack, determining whether there are performance issues in application code or architecture, or whether the issue is with the underlying infrastructure.

### What's Included: Observability + Context
